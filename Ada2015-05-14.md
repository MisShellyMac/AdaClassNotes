#More on Git

##Cloning
Cloning is the process of making a local copy of a remote git repository. We clone it to our machines to work with it.

##Upstream
Process of pushing a new local commit back to Github remote repo

##Fetch
Process of syncing your local repo to remote repo so you are getting all commits from all people working on it.
Can review before Pull so you know what is merged. Looks upstream to see if there are changes you care about.

##Pull  
Merge process. Take fetched changes and incorporate into your version.

##Branching
* Way to manage potentially conflicting commits.
* We basically only work in branches, NOT in the Master
* You tell git that you will only be working in a specified branch
* Once it is ready, you merge it into Master.
  * We might commit breakfast to Master, then branch for lunch, then merge to master when lunch is "ready"
* Good strategy for us: First branch is breakfast. Branch again for lunch. Once you finish lunch, merge it back into the main branch. Etc.

##Forking
* We all have our own implementation of each project, so each person will first create a local branch from the project and fork it.
* Fork = Make copy of project in YOUR github. Others' branches are in your working tree, too, but you can only modify your own. So the forks stay linked.
* When finished, one Ada repo with 24 branches, one for each of us
* Forking creates a copy from the source and puts it in your local github acct
  * then clone the fork onto your computer

##Push
* Process of merging your local clone back to your github.

##Pull request
* formal process of requesting that your clone is pulled back into the master repo
* You pull request on your branch in your github
* Only one pull request when your project is DONE.
* Formal request to merge the difference in commits on your branch on your fork onto your branch on the source.
* You don't own the Ada repo, so must request to be pulled in
* Can continue to make commits on your Github, but they won't appear in Ada repo
* PR both fetches and merges.
* You specify the BRANCH in your pull request. Any other branches won't appear.

##Push early, push often.

##Committing is a 2 step process
* Staging - put out there as something you care about. Can put 1 thing or mult things on stage at once.
* If you stage a file, then make changes, git won't stage those. If you then change it, you stage it again with the new changes.
* You then commit whatever is staged.


#Mastermind project - Live Code

#Turning things in:
see https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/topic_resources/how-to-turn-in-your-projects.md

##Turning in things WITH a rubric (includes pull request)
From "how-to-turn-in-your-projects.md"
* Do part 1 when you start a project
* part 2 while coding
* part 3 to turn in

Where to find Ada Projects to fork:
https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/C3Projects--Calculator
* In each, readme has req's, separate file for rubric called RUBRIC :)
* Clone as SSH (_not_ default of HTML)
*

##Turning in things WITHOUT a rubric (e.g., LTP exercises, Mastermind; these will be in your Github repo but not have a pull request)
