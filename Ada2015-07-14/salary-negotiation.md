## Negotiate early & often - why?
- plateaus around age 40, more like 37-38 for women.
- early salary _matters_; leads to big diffs in $ over one's career.
- 75% of those who ask for more $ get it

## Women are less likely to Negotiate
- less likely to ask for raises overall
- unconscious bias - mgrs less likely to want to work w women who negotiate.
- this will only change if women negotiate more

## Gender wage gap
- for similar work, with similar experience, etc.: 4-7% wage gap
- widens at the Director level and above (and fewer women in those roles).
- lack of women in senior leadership strongly contributes to pay inequity.

## Special challenges for women in tech
- more women leaving tech than going into it
- lack of role models, feeling like outsider - more commonly reported by women than men in tech

## Why?
- Consider you motivations - what would you use the $ for? Who would it help?
- Remember that your negotiation helps not just you but women in general.

## How?
- Determine your worth (could use payscale)
- Research company on glassdoor and through networking.
  - Network with other Adies! Find out starting salaries for others in the same position.
- Research center - can get info on payscale without completing survey, can research by company.
- ###Never provide a number or preferred salary range first.
  - Throw ball back in their court -- "I'm more interested in what this position pays," etc.
- Remember: You are expected to negotiate.
- Use data!
- Comp includes: Salary, Bonuses (based on what???), Equity, PTO (often something you can negotiate), Flex time, benefits, educational and growth opps (good investment - you are worth more the more skills you gain. can use this in reviews to substantiate a raise)

## Never take the first offer
Unless you're a jerk about it or they are jerks, they won't mind that you negotiate.

Do your research, then return with a specific counteroffer. A number.

## When to counter?
After initial offer:
  - get former offer letter with all details. ALWAYS.
  - take a few days to review. At least a day. (1-3 days is typical. Just ask!)
  - let them know if you have other offers or interviews scheduled. Matter-of-fact. No need to hide it.

## When to ask for raise?
- Performance reviews are the worst time. All the $ has already been split up and earmarked; there's nothing left.
- Instead, better to ask 3-6 months before. I'm going to ask for this; what do I need to do to ensure I'm on that track.
- Good to assess/ask about 1 mo post review as well. Planning for the next year.

## Script
"Not only do I have [all the standard req's] but I also possess [unique traits that make me a better candidate and worth more money]."
- We're coming in with other life experience and with communication skills. Highlight these.
- "I think we're really close here. Based on the research I've done and based on [xx standard skills] and [xx unique skills], I think I'm worth $xx" or "I think this job should be paying me $xx"

## Time is your trump card.
- Once you have offer and have gone back and forth...
- "So excited (etc.). If you can match [ASK] by 5pm tomorrow, I can't wait to sign."
- Hiring sucks; they want to get it over with.

## Notes on Payscale
PayScale - Worlds largest online compensation database. Everyone will benefit from transparency in pay - employers and employees.
- Provide transparent, anonymous salary info. Any can go, complete survey, and enter pay info. Will benchmark salary for you.
- Companies also use info to set their pay.
- unlimited PTO policy. Can be a nightmare, ask if its working. At Payscale, she says it works well, people actually do take vacations.
- Salary negotiation guide avail online.
