#Ruby 104 - More about conditionals & flow control

##Comparisons
< , >, ==, >=, >=, !=

##Negating comparisons
unless - like if but opposite. These are equivalent:

`unless number <= 10  
  puts "big number"  
else  
  puts "little number"  
end`  

unless x is the same as if !x, helps with clarity.

##Compound conditions
- && - everything must be true
- || - if any piece evaluates as true, whole expression evaluates as true. Looks for first true, then stops.
- & and | don't exist in Ruby! Yay!

- both sides must be COMPLETE CONDITIONS

##While
Execute while the condition is true.

`i = 0`

`while i < 4`  
`  puts i`  
`  i += 1`
`end`

0
1
2
3

Can lead to neverending loops

##Until
Opposite of while. Execute the iterator until the condition is true

`until i == 4  
  puts i  
  i += 1  
end`  

##include?
with array, does the value include a MEMBER of the array

with until, would be useful in calculator!

##Simplifying really complex conditionals
Instead of `if`/`elsif`, use `when` to check a parameter for specific cases/conditions.

`case parameter
  when "condition", "match" # this is an OR
    # do this
  when "next condition", "match"
    # do this
  else
    puts "wtf?"
end`
