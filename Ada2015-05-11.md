# Methods

create a reusable piece of code using def ... end

method name is used to call a method
* assigns the method name to a symbol (behind the scenes) and returns nil

## Parameters
Some methods include parameters. Add next to method name _without a space between_.
* parameter is passed into the method and assigned to name you gave it.
* if you don't give the right number of arguments, you will get an error.
* OR you can create a default... We'll go into this later.
* can require more than one parameter
* methods are passed parameters (the values you give when calling method) and accept arguments (the code you write next to method name with generic var names)
* variables created in a method are local. They do not exist after method is executed, only within the method
* methods are first written and then called... must call the method to run it and get the result.
* + and * etc are also methods, but they have special syntax you can use with them. Syntactic sugar! So, 2 + 2 => 4 could also be written as 2.+(2), and "2" + "2" => 22 could be written as "2".+("2")

###Single responsibility principle
each method should be responsible for one thing.

# Objects

arrays, integers, hashes, strings, etc, are all objects. Instances are also objects. Basically, (almost) everything is an object.

Ruby assigns each instance of an object a unique object ID when it is created (e.g., "hello" is an instance of String)

These have shortcut syntax for creation, but you can also make them with more traditional syntax.

  `my_array = Array.new`

is the same as:

  `my_array = []`

Arrays (and String and Integer etc) are _classes_

## Classes
### Creating a custom class

* Objects have attributes (like nouns or adjectives) and methods (like verbs)  
* A class is like an abstract idea into which many possible things may fit.
* When you set a class, you capitalize it. Variables CANNOT start with a capital letter.
* To run methods in the class, you must create a new object in that class (an _instance_), e.g., Chair.new.color (see class_ex.rb for example code)
  - In other words, you need to _instantiate the object_ before you can use it.
* defining the class is like the blueprint. Calling the class builds an instance using that blueprint. Defines its functionality.
* Can find out the class of an instance by calling .class on it.
* (objects you create seemingly outside a class are actually in the class _main_)
  * you can see this in irb with `self`

### initialize

* Special method we use when defining a method within a class. See class_ex.rb, example 2
* Not all initialize parameters have to have a corresponding method in order for the code to run. If one isn't defined, it will require the argument but with not do anything with it. It will return error if you try to use it: Method not defined.
* variables assigned here will be local to the method UNLESS you use the @ character before the method. Creates an _instance variable_ meaning that it lasts as long as the instance of the method lasts.
  * without @ you would be creating a local variable, one that doesn't exist outside the method.
  * (Global variables also exist in Ruby, but you don't really use them. They've been deprecated.)
* You will use classes A LOT
* Methods created to access the data through local vars are called _accessor methods_ or _the getter_
  * example:
  `def name
    @name
  end`
* _reassignment methods_ Methods in a class can be used to allow you to reassign the value of in instance var... Without this, you could never rename the value outside the class. AKA _the setter_.
  * example
  `def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end`
  * adding the = to the end of the method name makes it a special method used to allow reassignment to a new value
  * Method names in a class must be unique, but remember that `name` is a different than `name=`
    * three types of punctuation can be used in in method names: =, !, and ?
      * = makes it a reassignment method
      * ! makes denotes a permanent change method
      * ? as in `.include?`, results in a boolean

### attr
Way of making process outlined above easier. attr_reader is attribute reader, attr_writer is attribute writer.
  * see class_ex.rb example 3

You call the attr_reader method on symbols with names that correspond to your parameter names.

attr_accessor does both at once!!!
  * See class_ex.rb example 4.
