# Ruby Koans
- Study and practice tool. Related to red, green, refactor.
- Work kind of like tests. Contains a bunch of assertions; all are broken. Fix the first, green! Go to next. Fix, repeat.
- Meant to build on each other.
- For example, assert = false. Must change to true to move to next.
- Helps you have a better understanding of the concept at hand.


## Assertions
- Methods to verify code. Assertion EXPECT TRUE. When false, they fail.
- Written as Methods
    - assert - takes 1 expression and an optional message
    - assert_equal - takes 2 expressions and an optional message, returns true iff (if and only if) they're equal, error if not equal.
    - assert_nil
    - assert_match
