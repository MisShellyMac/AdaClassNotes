# Baby Dragon - live code project on classes

* add feeding variability
* make happy meter

## Private methods
* Must appear at end of file. Declare private keyword and all below is private
* Only available inside the class. By default, methods not declared private are available outside the class
* Tells others using code how you want these methods to be used.

## Instance variables (more)
* declared by starting name with @
* can be seen outside class IF added to attr
* local vars, on the other hand, can't be seen outside class.

#Random thing
tab tab shows all auto tab options

#Ruby Gems

* way people share code.
* to abstract common tasks. Like Packages in R.
* Most langs call this a library.
* creating a gem = gem cutting
* Three gems we'll use a lot
  * Rails (collection of about 30 gems)
  * Sinatra
  * Colorize (add colors to things in terminal)
* Gem = a command line utility for working with gems.
* To install gem:
  `gem install gemname`

  (requires an internet connection)
  * Next, you have to make it available to ruby using require
    `require 'money'`
    * add line at top of file... or can play with it using irb
    * separate multiple with a comma

* update - updates installed gems
* update system - Updates the 'gem' gem.

## Demo of using money gem (introducing-gems.md)

## GEMS divide & conquer
### awesome print
require

### geocode
`geocode -s geocoder_ca "47.678217, -122.386031"``
shows address closest to the geocode

in irb:
require "Geocoder"
Geocoder.search('Moz Seattle').first
Geocoder.search('address here').first

### pry
alternative version of irb
pry -r ./babydragon.rb
lists qualities of dragon in clearer format, diff lines for diff vars.

can also cd into the class you created.
cd BabyDragon
ls -M
