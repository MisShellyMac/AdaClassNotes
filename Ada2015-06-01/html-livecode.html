<font size ="6"><b>Thunderpaw the Destroyer</b></font>
<!-- font is a method that takes an argument. Kinda like a hash. Font takes a size argument. -->
<!-- line 2 is terrible HTML. Wordy. Unnecessarily complicated. Looks the same. -->
<!-- problem is that is does not express SEMANTIC VALUE of the content. h1 lets you know that this is what the page is about. Creates the structure and hierarchy that is the purpose of html. -->
<!--Semantics are critical in accessibility. Hierarchy and structure are needed for accessibility. Screen readers for the visually impaired know how to treat h1 differently, but can tell that the 2nd line is different from other text -->
<!-- line 1 is also easier to maintain. Can say "make all my h1s do xxx" -->
<!-- This is what google etc uses to describe relevance of diff types of info -->

<h1>Heading level 1</h1>            <!-- h means heading, h1 = Heading 1 -->
