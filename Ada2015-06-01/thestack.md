# THE STACK

Back in the day, the web stack was LAMP (Linux [operating system], Apache [http server], MySql [relational database], Php [web programming language; like ruby; orgs and ties together])

Still a popular stack

See hand written notes

This is a client server model. One remote source responsible for getting info to client. Client doesn't have direct access.

Front-end developers concern themselves with the browser and how the browser works with Php - Browser + Middleware

## OUR STACK:

Browser:
  - HTML/CSS - Today
  - Javascript

Middleware: Holds the two ends together. Peanut butter!
  - Ruby (Sinatra [tomorrow; ruby gem, simple webserver for Ruby] & Rails [also gem, but more complicated])

[ THIN/NGINX/PASSENGER - webservers ]

Data layer:
 - Postgres
 - (MySql :( sad face)
 - Redis

Ops:
 - OS X
 - Linux
 - Heroku
 - Git

You will leave this program able to do ALL of these things. You will have an affinity for some pieces over the other.
