## Class vs instance methods

Main problem with what we did yesterday -- stuck on instance variables. Trying to use them in class methods. Would go through flow, start self.all, and make an instance variable. BUT if wouldn't work when you went to self.find, bc had to be in specific order.

Class methods should be totally indep of one another and of class instance variables. Executed in no particular order and with no specific dependencies on initialization.

Class methods should not depend on each other. Retrieving all markets should never depend on one individual market.

BUT its ok for one class method to call another class method. Can use result of self.all to do self.find.

Distinction: Am I talking about a large colleciton of markets or abstract def of what is a market, probably class method. If properties of on specific instance of market, would need an instance method. Find needs to look through full collection of markets, so it is a class method. Vendor will be an instance method.

attr_accessor is a class method.

How to get stuff out of a class method.
- call all from find.

## Puts vs return

`def add(x,y)
  x + y   # this is the same as saying "return x + y -- Ruby auto returns last
          # object"
end`

if you put `puts` at the end of the method, it returns nil. Puts just puts, but it doesn't return anything. If you puts, then follow with a `return`, you will return the value.
