##Ruby 103

###Literals
_special syntax to rapidly create objects_

Source of some of Ruby's syntactic sugar -- ways Ruby makes our lives easier by interpreting input.

for example, in "string" the "" are the string literal. Otherwise, we'd have to do
  `x = String.new("string")`

  [ ] - array literal

  { } - hash literal

  123 - fixnum literal
  etc.

% notation - see notes

%w(dog cat taco) # makes an array
=> ["dog", "cat", "taco"]

%w{} #creates an array
%W{} # creates an array you can interpolate into

x = "hey"
%I(I want to say #{x}) => [:I, :want, :to, :say, :hey]

%q{} = creates a string
%Q{} = creates a string that you can interpolate into

%x{say -v zarvox Good afternoon girls} # says "Good afternoon girls" in the voice called zarvox.

%i{tacos are awesome} => [:tacos, :are, :awesome] # creates an array of symbols

Heredocs are also literals (advantage: don't have to escape. Will preserve formatting.)

  heredoc_string = <<END

    This is a poem.
    A silly poem.
    It is indented.
  END

  array_of_strings = [<<ONE, <<TWO, <<THREE]
    The first stanza
  ONE
    The second stanza
  TWO
    The third stanza
  THREE

  puts array_of_strings

Ranges: .. and ...
>  1..100 # range up to and including 100
  1...100 # range up to but not including 100

>  Works with floats as well. Anything between the values

>  will only count up, won't count down.

>  also works with letters
  `("a".."z").each { |i| print i }`

=== # includes, returns a true or false
  `1..5 === 4` => true`

Escape keys
> \a  # triggers alert noise
> \" # escape double quotes
> \u # escape to use unicode symbols. e.g., `shift = "\u21E7"` # gives shift symbol


## Iterators & Blocks
  - .times
  - .each

###Blocks
  - section of code not executed immediately.
  - the section between do and end, or between { and }
  - do and end is more commonly used than {} in ruby.
  - block arguments are the part between ||. This is the name given to the variable used in that specific block.

###Loops
To understand loops at first, it's useful to create a table:

>`[11, 5, 8, 100].each do |n|
  puts n * 4
end`

loop count /   value of n  /  output

1          /   11          /  44

etc

if a variable is assigned BEFORE a block, then reassigned within the block, the variable will have the ending value from the block NOT the original pre-block value

> Jeremy: Blocks clean up, but they only clean up after themselves. They don't clean up variables that don't belong to them.
