# Notes from POODR Ch1

## Duck typing
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck..."
How Ruby works. E.g., if it looks like an integer, treat it like an integer.

## OOD
 - seeing projects as objects and messages between them
 - everything is an object
 - allow adaptation. Certainty is unattainable.

 Estimating time - Storypoints?

## Object-oriented vs procedural languages


# More On Complexity - Big O

O is for Omicron or Order of Magnitude.

## Big O Notation
Mathematical function for graphing/quantifying complexity of algorithms.
- it is a simplification. Constants are ignored. For sums, the worst case (with largest growth rate) is taken.
- space and time required
- worst case scenario

### Types of complexity
Matters most when you have many elements.
