Ways to get better at Estimating
1. Equivalency bet - pretend bet $1000 on it
2. repetition and feedback - consider why wrong and use info in next est.
3. consider two pros and two cons - consider 2 reasons you should be confident in est and 2 reason you might be wrong.
4. avoid anchoring - already have idea in head and get stuck on it
5. reverse the anchoring effect - absurdity test. start really wide, then narrow.
