#Hashes

* Hashes can contain anything as a value, even another hash.
* Hashes can be grouped into an array of keys and values.
* A hash is a great way to pass in arguments to the initialize method of a class.

* See Address class example in Ada github notes (/hash.md)
  `class Address
    def initialize(first_name, last_name, street_one, street_two, city, state, country, postal code)`

  etc. instead becomes:

      `class Address`
        `def initialize(address_hash)`
          `@first_name = address_hash[:first_name]
          more vars here
        end`

  etc.

  `Address.new(first_name: "Jeremy", state: "WA")`

  * Now you don't have to have values for everything. It will just show `nil` for keys that don't have a value. In the prior version, you'd have to have all paramenters and fill missings with "".
  * Also, it now doesn't care about order! You can enter key:value pairs in any order.
  * To add last name, you'd just say `Address.last_name = "xxx"`


#Default attribute values for methods
* Very common for methods to have optional values
* BUT REMEMBER: _SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE!_

To do this:

        `def exponate(base, power = 2) # sets power to default of 2
          base ** power
        end`

Not a great use of the optional argument, though...

see second example with `abs = false` as default

If you have a method that needs multiple parameters and you might want to use some and not the others (through optional parameters), _use a hash_ for your parameter
